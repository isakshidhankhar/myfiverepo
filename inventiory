Inventory:
Inventory refers to the goods, materials, or products that a business holds for the purpose of resale or production. It includes raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Managing inventory effectively is crucial for meeting customer demand, minimizing storage costs, and ensuring smooth operations. Poor inventory control can lead to stockouts or overstocking, both of which affect profitability.
